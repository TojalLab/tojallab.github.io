# About Tojal Lab

We are a SÃ£o Paulo-based research group that is interested in bioinformatics, genomics and imaging, focusing on its
intersection with machine learning and artificial intelligence. We aim to develop novel methods and tools to analyze,
integrate, and interpret large-scale biological data, and to apply them to address real-world problems in biomedicine
and biotechnology.

Our laboratory is composed of talented and motivated researchers from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, such as
computer science, mathematics, statistics, biology, and medicine. Our goal is to work  collaboratively and 
creatively to advance the
frontiers of knowledge and innovation in our field.

We are always looking for new members who share our passion and vision. Check out the [join us](/joinus) page for more
